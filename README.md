# Mapbox POC
In this sample POC application i load all the pharmacy near the user's location with the help of mapbox and google places api.
For more information visit the [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [google places API](https://developers.google.com/places/)<br>

**Map Animations are easy using mapbox,also you can customize the map such as blue for water regions and green for parks etc.**<br/><br/>

**Also you can set your own custom marker,marker title, and more description about the marker.**In this example i have used customized plus sign markers to denote medical shops.<br/><br/>

**Please note:**<br/>
Once you have downloaded the project, make sure u have the mapbox sdk key and a google places api key(Browser key) added in your gradle.properties or you can replace BuildConfig.API_KEY with your own API keys.
